Hello world!  This is the website for Field Cady.
I am a data scientist and researcher based on Edmonds, WA.
I have worked on a diverse set of problems and try to solve
them in the simplest way possible, but I have been specializing
in stochastic modeling and machine learning (including deep learning).
</p>

<p>
I am the author of The Data Science Handbook and the
upcoming Data Science: the Executive Summary, both published
by Wiley & Sons.
</p>

<p>
This website is basically a stub for the time being, but you can
find links below to a more comprehensive overview of my work.
